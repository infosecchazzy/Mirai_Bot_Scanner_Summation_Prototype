The Suricata folder contains the programs and configuration files necessary 
to produce an alert log of Bots attempting to connect to potential new Bot Victims.

The folder consists of the following files:
* Alert_Dataset.bat, which is a batch file for calling Suricata to alert on each PCAP file of the Bot scanning dataset;
* Convert_Pcap.py, which converts the PNCAP files of the Bot scanning dataset to PCAP format;
* mirai-bot-scanning.rules, which contains the Suricata rule for detecting when 
  a Bot is attempting to connect to a potential new Bot Victim;
* suricata.yml, which contains the configuration for the Suricata alert log.
